# AmesPricingSolutions
A few solutions of prediction house price in Ames.
ExpLinReg --- linear regression with target logarithm trick (trying to decrease random deviation in assuming that y that we get is not actual price of the house)
KNR --- nothing special, just trying to apply KNeighborRegression to this dataset.
